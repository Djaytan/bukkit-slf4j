# Types of contributions :memo:

You can contribute to the JobsReborn place-break patch in several ways. This repo is a place to
discuss and collaborate!

### :mega: Discussions

Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to
share something amazing you've experimented with our patch, join us in
[discussions](https://github.com/github/docs/discussions).

### :lady_beetle: Issues

[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to
track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue doesn't have any label yet, this means
we haven't reviewed it yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found a bug, a weird behavior or an exploit with the patch, search open issues to see if
someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a
[template](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a
conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests

A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
is a way to suggest changes in our repository. When we merge those changes, they would be deployed
in the next release by the maintainer. :earth_africa:

### :question: Support

We are a small team working hard to making the patch working well in as many situations as possible.
However, we are not directly related to the JobsReborn team, and thus we will not be able to help
you when your problem will be out of our scope (i.e. the patch itself and how to integrate it with
JobsReborn).

If you have any question related to JobsReborn, please open an issue
[here](https://github.com/Zrips/Jobs).
