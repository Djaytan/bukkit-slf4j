## First Contribution

If this is your first contribution, we recommend you to get familiar with the process through
this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).

## Getting Started

Actually, there isn't documentation which will permit you to navigate in our codebase with
confidence. Fortunately, one will be added soon:
https://github.com/Djaytan/mc-jobs-reborn-patch-place-break/issues/46

If you want to work on Bukkit related aspects, you will find the API JavaDoc
[here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/).

A [wiki](https://bukkit.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) exists as well to get familiar with Bukkit
core concepts.

Anyway, if you have any question, don't hesitate to
[ask us](https://github.com/Djaytan/mc-jobs-reborn-patch-place-break/discussions)! We are here
to help you for getting started.

## Pull Requests

1. Try to open several smaller PRs instead of only a big one, it will make the job of the reviewers
   easier.
2. Give a summary of the changes provided by your PR. Link any related issue, discussion or
   documentation that could help the reviewer understand your work, the impacts and the plus-value.
3. You will need at least one approval of a reviewer before being able to merge the PR.
4. All automatic jobs must pass (CircleCI, SonarQube analysis, formatting verification, ...) before
   merging.

## Windows - Long Paths

> "Git has a limit of 4096 characters for a filename, except on Windows when Git is compiled with
> msys. It uses an older version of the Windows API and there's a limit of 260 characters for a
> filename." - _From StackOverflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/22575737_

Since some files in project exceed 265 characters long, it is required to overcome this limitation.

To solve the issue, run with administrator rights the following command:

```
$ git config --system core.longpaths true
```

## Code Formatting

The only thing we ask when contributing to the code is to apply
[google-java-format](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) style guidelines.

To help respecting this, an automatic-formatter as been configured through Maven to be dispatched
automatically when building the project and running tests. If you forgot to run Maven before
committing and pushing your changes, your PR will be prevented from being merged by our CI until
you solve the issue.

### IntelliJ IDEA plugin

If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you can install the
[google-java-format plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8527-google-java-format) which will
replace the default IDE code formatting behavior.

Take care to well follow [these instructions](https://github.com/google/google-java-format/blob/master/README.md#intellij-jre-config).
