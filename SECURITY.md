## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our open
source software. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to
acknowledge your contributions.

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities by creating a new issue. You will receive a
response from us within one week at most, but most probably within few hours or days. If the issue
is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity.
